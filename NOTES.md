# Notes (Optional)
Task 2 — Count Valid Emails :

When I search for what is valid email, I found out there are so many rules.
I tried to implement most of them but there are too detailed ones. For example writing comments in parathesis is allowed in both local and domain parts of an email or using disallowed characters in quotes is allowed.
